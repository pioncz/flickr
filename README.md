Scripts:  
`npm run build` - build for production  
`npm run serve` - run development server  
`npm run tests` - open cypress gui to run e2e tests  
  
Tests:  
At first i wanted to create tests with jest + puppeteer which i know, but it takes a while to setup, so i decided to give a shot cypress and it looks really cool.
